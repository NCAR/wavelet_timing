# Wavelet Timing:

Codes to reproduce "A Wavelet-Based Approach to Streamflow Event Identification and Modeled Timing Error Evaluation"  
By  E. Towler, J.L. McCreight  

This repository supplies the code to reproduce the figures in the manuscript and the supplemental.  

The code relies on functions in the [`rwrfhydro`](https://github.com/NCAR/rwrfhydro) R package.  

The ipython notebook, [all_figures.ipynb](all_figures.ipynb), provides the best entry point including installing `rwrfhydro` and showing the codes called for each figure above the figure itself.
