# Wavelet Timing: Codes to reproduce "A Wavelet-Based Approach to Streamflow Event Identification and Modeled Timing Error Evaluation"

Authors: E. Towler, J.L. McCreight

This repository supplies the code to reproduce the figures in the manuscript. The code relies on functions in the [`rwrfhydro`](https://github.com/NCAR/rwrfhydro) R package which is [installed as descrbed at its homepage](https://github.com/NCAR/rwrfhydro#installing).
