All code is executed and figures and tables are displayed in the jupyter 
notebook ([all_figures.ipynb](all_figures.ipynb)). The easiest way to **view** the 
notebook is to look at the [the exported html of the notebook using this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NCAR/wavelet_timing/blob/master/all_figures.html). The best way to 
**interact** with the code is to clone the repository and open the notebook in jupyter-lab.

Please note well that the code was written prior to several major changes in R including 
a new major R version and changes to ggplot2. The code has not (yet) been adapted to these 
recent changes. The notebook prints `sessionInfo()` to document the dependencies used to 
run this code. Please note these dependencies when running the codes.
