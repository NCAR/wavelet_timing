The ipython notebook, [all_figures.ipynb](all_figures.ipynb), provides the best entry point. The code was written prior to several major changes in R including a new major R version and changes to ggplot2. The code has not (yet) been adapted to these recent changes. The notebook prints `sessionInfo()` to document the dependencies used to run this code. Please note these dependencies.
