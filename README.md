# Wavelet Timing:

Codes to reproduce "A Wavelet-Based Approach to Streamflow Event Identification and Modeled Timing Error Evaluation"  
By  E. Towler, J.L. McCreight  

This repository supplies the code to reproduce the figures in the manuscript and the supplemental.  

The code relies on functions in the [`rwrfhydro`](https://github.com/NCAR/rwrfhydro) R package.  

The ipython notebook, [all_figures.ipynb](all_figures.ipynb), provides the best entry point including installing `rwrfhydro` and showing the codes called for each figure above the figure itself.

The code here was written prior to several major changes in R (new major version) and ggplot2. As of this writing the software has not been updated but it maybe in the future. For now, the requirements for reproducibility are closely approximated by:
